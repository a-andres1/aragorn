an app to help you track your employees

## Description
I just way over complicated this. I used too many things and got super out of my league on this. I couldn't figure out why this project was so difficult. I asked for some help and I got a good reset with my tutor. He showed me all the places that I was making this way more difficult. After that I was able to actually get some code written and get this working. 


Had to start with the department table since it doesn't contain any foreign keys. That way mySQL isn't looking for anything and won't throw errors.
